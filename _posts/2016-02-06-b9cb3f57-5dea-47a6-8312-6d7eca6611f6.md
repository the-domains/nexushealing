Do you understand the Law of Attraction,

but find it's not always working for you? 

Did you know that creation can only happen when

you are free of limiting beliefs and self doubts? 

Come and be guided deep into your subconscious mind where you can explore what limited beliefs and self doubts you have that you may not even know about. This specific type of Discovery Breathwork will help you learn the truth. Clearing these old beliefs and doubts are your keys to successfully using the Law of Attraction.

With guided meditation, breathwork, energy tools, energy work, powerful music, beautiful smells, and positive affirmations, you will be able to go deeper than ever before. 

You will feel sensations in the body and the location is representative of a limited belief or self doubt you have. You will learn things about yourself that you didn't have the courage to face alone, but together we can face them.
